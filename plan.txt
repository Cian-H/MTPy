plan of action:
- add binning
- add w3 and w4 (or w2_1 and w2_2 or something) for second pyrometer
- Switch to dask (vaex isnt being maintained enough)
- use in-place julia/rust functions where even more speed is required
- update docstrings (maybe use automated extension for this?)
- use __init__ to simplify API
- maybe use pyvista or ipyvolume instead of plotly???
- clean up namespaces with config files?
- Maybe switch to using holoviews?
- Add a dashboard using dash
