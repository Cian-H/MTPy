plan of action:
- add binning
- add w3 and w4 (or w2_1 and w2_2 or something) for second pyrometer
- use vaex multithreading for speed boost
- use numba (and other JIT) applied to vaex columns for further speed boost
- use in-place julia functions where even more speed is required
- update docstrings (maybe use automated extension for this?)
- use __init__ to simplify API
- maybe use ipyvolume instead of plotly???
- clean up namespaces with config files?
- Maybe switch to using holoviews?
- Add a dashboard using dash (https://medium.com/plotly/interactive-and-scalable-dashboards-with-vaex-and-dash-9b104b2dc9f0
    as starting point?)
